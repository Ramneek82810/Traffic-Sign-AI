# 🚦Traffic Sign Recognition using Deep Learning

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based AI system designed to automatically recognize German traffic signs from images. This project leverages the GTSRB dataset to train a model that can assist in autonomous driving systems by accurately detecting and classifying traffic signs.

## 🧠Key Features

- 🧾 Recognizes and classifies over 40 different types of traffic signs
- 🖼️ Handles `.ppm` format images from the GTSRB dataset
- 🧠 Built using CNNs with multiple convolution and pooling layers
- 📉 Outputs training loss and accuracy graphs for performance evaluation
- 📌 Visualizes predictions on actual sign images
- 🔁 Easily extendable to other datasets (e.g., LISA Traffic Sign Dataset)

## 🎯 Real-World Applications

- 🚗 Self-driving cars and ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems)
- 📸 Traffic sign compliance monitoring via dashcams
- 🧠 Driver training and simulation software
- 📊 Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS)

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Load Dataset**: Reads `.ppm` image files and associated labels
2. **Preprocessing**: Resizes images, normalizes pixel values
3. **Model Building**: Uses a CNN architecture with convolution, ReLU, max-pooling, dropout, and dense layers
4. **Training**: Optimized with categorical cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer
5. **Evaluation**: Accuracy score, confusion matrix, and prediction visualization
6. **Prediction**: Uses trained model to identify traffic signs in unseen images
